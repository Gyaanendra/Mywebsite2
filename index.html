       Before teddy bears could be sold, Michtom had to get President Roosevelt’s permission to use his name. Which he did and so the era of Teddy’s bear began!
       You can get teddy bears that are made from alpaca pelt today. This kind of teddy bear is going to be very soft and expensive!
       There is a dedicated magazine to teddy bears. This magazine is called ‘Teddy Bear and Friends’. It has about 40,000 subscribers.
       ‘The Teddy Bear’s Picnic’ tune, that we all will, no doubt, be singing by the end of this article, was written by John Walter Bratton.
       There are about 2,000 speciality bear making stores in America! This does not count stores like Build-A-Bear.
